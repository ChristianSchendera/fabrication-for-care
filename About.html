        <p>I am a 25 years old student at Rhine-Waal University. My Degree is based on International Business combined with Social Siences. I am currently in my 5th Semester and propably will leave next winter 2020.</p>
        <p>During my studies I were transacting an Interdisciplinary Project within Digital Manufacturing in a groupd of students of all different fields. The goal was to develop a product for care with the opportunities the FabLab Kamp-Lintfort gives us. With no technically experience, I started to do my best practicing.</p>

            <h2>What I've done so far</h2>
            <p>I grew up in a small part of Kamp-Lintfort in a time, when this University did not even exists and so did I: I never thought of going to University in any period of my live.</p>
                <li>In my early live, I was much into social working and did my first experiences in a german kindergarten, which definitely was really fun. I was also supervised youth groups on weekly gatherings as well as on vacations all around Europe. This typicaly was organzied by church.</li>
                <li>Than I learned a lot about Money and Investing during my Application as a Management Assitent for Finances, working as a conducting clerk for insurances. That was highly interesting, because you get in touch with many different people with all kinds of different background. It is another aspect of learning about people. The work was highly demanding, I worked many hours in the evening and sometimes on the weekends to reach a higher amount of people and need to be creative in finding ways of getting contacts. Than I learned, that qualtiy goes above quantity and I figgered out, that it is important to improve myself. Instead of spending more and more hours in the office, I honestly did the necessary stuff to satisfied the supervisers and started to read many many many books. Psychological, Scientific, Lifelearning/Interesting books. Because that should not be everything what I learn, I started studiyng</li>
                <li>Based on my experiences as a Insurance clerk, I started my bachelor in International Business and social sience at Rhine-Waal University. Some subjects already faced, what I learned before in business school during my apprenticeship, some were very new. I personaly was really interested in subjects like  marketing, human resources & finances. What added another field to my interests of education was the interdisciplinary project in which I learn the basics of digital fabrication. This includes 3D scanning, assembling & printing - Laser cutting - producing wearables in terms of knitting, embroidering and stitching - many supporting issues like solding, grinding, cutting - electricity - programming - combined with several usable programmes for all these issues.</li>
                <p>In my final project you see how all these learning outcomes are concludet in one product</p>
