        <p>Soft Robotics are mobile components which can be moved for example by air pressure. In Care fabrication it can be used for assistive fingers or like the picture in the showcase for machines to pick materials.<br>
        We took the bodyscan of Leyla which also can be found in the Assignment of 3D scanning and wanted to build an breath assistant which should pressure the lungs for helping to exhale and same the other way around. </p>
