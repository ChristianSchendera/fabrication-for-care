    <h3><li>Think of a title for your project</li>
        <li>This project is an assistive device, so it needs to be a system composed of sensing and actuation. (we will work on it in the next days)</li> 
        <li>This device is intended to be wearable or to fit the person ( personalized ).</li>
        <li>DIY, The prototype of this project must be initialised in the FabLab.</li>
        <li>This device needs to be aesthetically pleasing.</li>
        <li>For your final projects, please bring sketches of your ideas, scenarios where some of the patients may be involved, look for relative works all existing projects in the scientific and commercial field.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to document it in your website ❤ ☺!</li>

        <p>This week we are going to connect some components to a Microcontroller and want to programm it to do something.</p>

        <div class="column">
        <img src="A6 images/Bild 1.jpeg" width="100%">
            <p>Our programmer is the Arduino Uno. We also use a Breadbord and some wires. The Arduino Uno comes along with:
           </p>
        <img src="A6 images/Bild 3.jpg" width="100%">
            <p>First thing we want to do is to turn on an LED. An LED has a negative and a positive side and needs 3.3v. You have to take care, to put the ends in the right direction, as well as put a 499Ohm Resistor between + and the LED.</p>
            <img src="A6 images/IMG_5601.jpg"width="100%">
            <p>The Arduino has a USB connector with which you can programm it. You also need the Arduino Software which is free to download.
            Once started the Software, you have to choose your Board and a new sketch opens.</p>

                <p>We used Pin Output 13 to connect the LED with our Microcontroller and also set the instructions of our scetch.</p>
