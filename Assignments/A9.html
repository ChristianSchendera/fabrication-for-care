        <h2><strong>weekly assignments</strong></h2>
    <h3><li>Individual introduction of an assignment: we want to present the Audience what you did/ develop and troubleshooting during this Semester, the presentation of this assignment should take 3 min, and you will use your website as a resource of explanation for the project.</li>
        <li>Presentation teams: eeach team should make a presentation of your project with the four requirements discussed in the last weeks, please consider what we have concerning:</li> 
        <li>This device is intended to be wearable or to fit the person ( personalized ).</li>
        <li>This project is an assistive device, so it needs to be a system composed of sensing and actuation. (we will work on it in the next days)</li>
        <li>This device is intended to be wearable or to fit the person ( personalized).</li>
        <li>DIY, The prototype of this project must be initialised in the FabLab.</li>
        <li>This device needs to be aesthetically pleasing.</li>
        <li>small mock up: what is making how will works your final project</li>
        <li>Project plan what will happen the next weeks</li>

        <p>
            Another way of build a Sensor than to knit, especially for other purposes is to place to conductive material parallel to foam material. If you press on one side, the two conductive materials come closer to each other and current can flow more or less to the other side. This can be meassured with a Microcontroller.
