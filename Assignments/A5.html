            <p>Place the Material you like to cut in the Laser cutter</p>
        <img src="A5%20images/2.jpg">
            <p>The lines you want to cut can be colored for differiention between many values of power or speed, the Laser should go on the material. For this material I used Power: 20, Speed: 100, Frequency: 100. This term is called colour-mapping</p>
            <img src="A5%20images/4.jpg"><p>
            After you chose the setting, you need to set the laser in the right distance, as well as place it on the point, where it should start.</p>

            <div class="column">
            <img src="A5%20images/3.jpg">
            <p>Colour-mapping can be used to figger out which settings should be used. Basically you draw some figueres and try out different values of power, speed and so on to evaluate which one fits best for your specific material</p> 
        <img src="A5%20images/5.jpg"><p>As you can see, the Laser has cutted succesfully and all cuts were clear (nothing burned)</p>
